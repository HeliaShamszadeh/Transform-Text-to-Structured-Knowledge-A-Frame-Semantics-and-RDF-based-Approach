American author, anthropologist, filmmaker (1891–1960) Zora Neale Hurston (January 7, 1891 : 17 : 5 – January 28, 1960) was an American writer, anthropologist , folklorist , and documentary filmmaker . She portrayed racial struggles in the early-20th-century American South and published research on Hoodoo and Caribbean Vodou . The most popular of her four novels is Their Eyes Were Watching God , published in 1937. She also wrote more than 50 short stories, plays, an autobiography, ethnographies, and many essays. Hurston was born in Notasulga, Alabama , and moved with her family to Eatonville, Florida , in 1894. She later used Eatonville as the setting for many of her stories. In her early career, Hurston conducted anthropological and ethnographic research as a scholar at Barnard College and Columbia University . She had an interest in African-American and Caribbean folklore, and how these contributed to the community's identity. She also wrote about contemporary issues in the black community and became a central figure of the Harlem Renaissance . Her short satires, drawing from the African-American experience and racial division, were published in anthologies such as The New Negro and Fire!! After moving back to Florida, Hurston wrote and published her literary anthology on African-American folklore in North Florida, Mules and Men (1935), and her first three novels: Jonah's Gourd Vine (1934); Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937); and Moses, Man of the Mountain (1939). Also published during this time was Tell My Horse: Voodoo and Life in Haiti and Jamaica (1938), documenting her research on rituals in Jamaica and Haiti. Hurston's works concerned both the African-American experience and her struggles as an African-American woman. Her novels went relatively unrecognized by the literary world for decades.
