American science fiction author (1928–1982) Philip Kindred Dick (December 16, 1928 – March 2, 1982) was an American science fiction short story writer and novelist. He wrote 44 novels and about 121 short stories , most of which appeared in science fiction magazines . His fiction explored varied philosophical and social questions such as the nature of reality , perception , human nature , and identity , and commonly featured characters struggling against alternate realities , illusory environments, monopolistic corporations, drug abuse, authoritarian governments, and altered states of consciousness . He is considered one of the most important figures in 20th-century science fiction. Born in Chicago , Dick moved to the San Francisco Bay Area with his family at a young age. He began publishing science fiction stories in 1952, at age 23. He found little commercial success until his alternative history novel The Man in the High Castle (1962) earned him acclaim, including a Hugo Award for Best Novel , when he was 33. He followed with science fiction novels such as Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (1968) and Ubik (1969). His 1974 novel Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said won the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel . Following years of drug use and a series of mystical experiences in 1974, Dick's work engaged more explicitly with issues of theology , metaphysics , and the nature of reality, as in the novels A Scanner Darkly (1977), VALIS (1981), and The Transmigration of Timothy Archer (1982). A collection of his speculative nonfiction writing on these themes was published posthumously as The Exegesis of Philip K. Dick (2011). He died in 1982 at the age of 53 due to complications of a stroke. Following his death, he became "widely regarded as a master of imaginative, paranoid fiction in the vein of Franz Kafka and Thomas Pynchon ". Dick's posthumous influence has been widespread, extending beyond literary circles into Hollywood filmmaking.
