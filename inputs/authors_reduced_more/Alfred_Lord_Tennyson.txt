( August 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson FRS ( / ˈ t ɛ n ɪ s ən / ; 6 August 1809 – 6 October 1892) was an English poet. He was Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom during much of Queen Victoria 's reign. In 1829 he was awarded the Chancellor's Gold Medal at Cambridge for one of his first pieces, "Timbuktu". He published his first solo collection of poems, Poems, Chiefly Lyrical , in 1830. " Claribel " and " Mariana ", which remain some of Tennyson's most celebrated poems, were included in this volume. Although described by some critics as overly sentimental, his poems ultimately proved popular and brought Tennyson to the attention of well-known writers of the day, including Samuel Taylor Coleridge . Tennyson's early poetry, with its medievalism and powerful visual imagery, was a major influence on the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood . Tennyson also focused on short lyrics, such as " Break, Break, Break ", " The Charge of the Light Brigade ", " Tears, Idle Tears ", and " Crossing the Bar ". Much of his verse was based on classical mythological themes, such as " Ulysses " and " The Lotos-Eaters ". " In Memoriam A.H.H. " was written to commemorate his friend Arthur Hallam , a fellow poet and student at Trinity College, Cambridge , after he died of a stroke at the age of 22. Tennyson also wrote notable blank verse , including Idylls of the King , "Ulysses", and " Tithonus ". During his career, Tennyson attempted drama, but his plays enjoyed little success.
