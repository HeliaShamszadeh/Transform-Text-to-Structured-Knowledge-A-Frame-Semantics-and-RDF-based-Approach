English novelist and poet (1816–1855) Charlotte Bronte ( née Brontë ; 21 April 1816 – 31 March 1855), commonly known as Charlotte Brontë ( / ˈ ʃ ɑːr l ə t ˈ b r ɒ n t i / , commonly /- t eɪ / ), was an English novelist and poet, and was the elder sister of Emily , Anne and Branwell Brontë . She is best known for her novel Jane Eyre , which was published under the pseudonym Currer Bell . Jane Eyre was a success on publication, and has since become known as a classic of English literature . Charlotte was the third of six siblings born to Maria Branwell , the daughter of a Cornish merchant, and Patrick Brontë , an Irish clergyman. Maria died when Charlotte was only five years old, and three years later, Charlotte was sent to the Clergy Daughters' School at Cowan Bridge in Lancashire, along with her three sisters, Maria, Elizabeth and Emily. Conditions at the school were appalling, with frequent outbreaks of disease. Charlotte's two elder sisters fell ill there and died; Charlotte attributed her own lifelong ill-health to her time at Cowan Bridge, and later used it as the model for Lowood School in Jane Eyre . In 1831, Charlotte became a pupil at Roe Head School in Mirfield , but left the following year in order to teach her sisters, Emily and Anne , at home. In 1835, Charlotte returned to Roe Head as a teacher. In 1839, she accepted a job as governess to a local family, but left after a few months. In 1842, Charlotte joined the Heger Pensionnat, a girls' boarding school in Brussels , as a student teacher, in the hope of acquiring the skills required to open a school of her own. However she was obliged to leave after falling in love with the school's director, Constantin Heger , a married man, who inspired both the character of Rochester in Jane Eyre , and Charlotte's first novel, The Professor . Charlotte, Emily and Anne then attempted to open a school in Haworth, but failed to attract pupils.
