Walter Whitman Jr. ( / ˈ hw ɪ t m ə n / ; May 31, 1819 – March 26, 1892) was an American poet, essayist, and journalist; he also wrote two novels. He is considered one of the most influential poets in American literature and world literature . Whitman incorporated both transcendentalism and realism in his writings and is often called the father of free verse .

Whitman was born in Huntington on Long Island and lived in Brooklyn as a child and through much of his career. At age 11, he left formal schooling to go to work. He worked as a journalist, a teacher, and a government clerk. Whitman's major poetry collection, Leaves of Grass , first published in 1855, was financed with his own money and became well known.

" and " When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd ", and gave a series of lectures on Lincoln .
