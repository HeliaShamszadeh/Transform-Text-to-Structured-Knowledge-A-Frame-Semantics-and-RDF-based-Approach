His influence on Russian literature is felt in modern times, through his poetry, but also his prose, which founded the tradition of the Russian psychological novel . Lermontov was born on October 15, 1814 in Moscow into the Lermontov family and grew up in Tarkhany . Lermontov's father, Yuri Petrovich, was a military officer who married Maria Mikhaylovna Arsenyeva, a young heiress from an aristocratic family. Their marriage was unhappy, Maria's health deteriorated, and she died of tuberculosis in 1817. A family dispute ensued over Lermontov's custody, resulting in his grandmother, Elizaveta Arsenyeva, raising him. She provided excellent home education, nurturing his talents in languages, music, and painting. However, his health was fragile, and he suffered from scrofula and rickets . His grandmother's strict control caused him emotional turmoil, leading to his development as a lonely and introspective individual. Lermontov's early life experiences and education laid the foundation for his literary achievements. In 1827, Lermontov moved to Moscow with his grandmother and joined the Moscow University's boarding school.
