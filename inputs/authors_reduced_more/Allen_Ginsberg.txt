American poet and writer (1926–1997) For the American businessman, see Alan Ginsburg . For the serial killer who was born Allen Ginsberg, see William MacDonald (serial killer) . Irwin Allen Ginsberg ( / ˈ ɡ ɪ n z b ɜːr ɡ / ; June 3, 1926 – April 5, 1997) was an American poet and writer. As a student at Columbia University in the 1940s, he began friendships with Lucien Carr , William S. Burroughs and Jack Kerouac , forming the core of the Beat Generation . He vigorously opposed militarism , economic materialism and sexual repression and he embodied various aspects of this counterculture with his views on drugs, sex, multiculturalism , hostility to bureaucracy and openness to Eastern religions . Best known for his poem " Howl ", Ginsberg denounced what he saw as the destructive forces of capitalism and conformity in the United States. San Francisco police and US Customs seized copies of "Howl" in 1956 and a subsequent obscenity trial in 1957 attracted widespread publicity due to the poem's language and descriptions of heterosexual and homosexual sex at a time when sodomy laws made male homosexual acts a crime in every state. The poem reflected Ginsberg's own sexuality and his relationships with a number of men, including Peter Orlovsky , his lifelong partner. Judge Clayton W. Horn ruled that "Howl" was not obscene, asking: "Would there be any freedom of press or speech if one must reduce his vocabulary to vapid innocuous euphemisms?" Ginsberg was a Buddhist who extensively studied Eastern religious disciplines . He lived modestly, buying his clothing in second-hand stores and residing in apartments in New York City's East Village . One of his most influential teachers was Tibetan Buddhist Chögyam Trungpa , the founder of the Naropa Institute in Boulder, Colorado . At Trungpa's urging, Ginsberg and poet Anne Waldman started The Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics there in 1974.
