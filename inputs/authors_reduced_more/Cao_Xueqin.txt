Chinese novelist and poet (1710–1765) In this Chinese name , the family name is Cao . Stone statue of Cao Xueqin Cao Xueqin ( [tsʰǎʊ ɕɥètɕʰǐn] tsow sh'weh-chin ; 4 April 1710 – 10 June 1765) was a Chinese novelist and poet during the Qing dynasty . He is best known as the author of Dream of the Red Chamber , one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature . His given name was Cao Zhan ( 曹霑 ) and his courtesy name was Mengruan . The dates of Cao Xueqin's birth and death are a matter of debate. His birth date can be confined to between 1715 and 1724, as attested by the elegiac poems by his friends – Duncheng ( 敦誠 ) and Zhang Yiquan ( 張宜泉 ) – which stated Cao was forty and nearly fifty respectively when he died. He was born to a Han Chinese clan that was brought into personal service (as booi aha or bondservants of Cigu Niru ) to the Manchu royalty in the late 1610s. His ancestors distinguished themselves through military service in the Plain White Banner of the Eight Banners and subsequently held posts as officials which brought both prestige and wealth. After the Plain White Banner was put under the direct jurisdiction of the Qing emperor, Cao's family began to serve in civil positions of the Imperial Household Department . During the Kangxi Emperor 's reign, the clan's prestige and power reached its height. Cao grandfather, Cao Yin ( 曹寅 ), was a childhood playmate to Kangxi while Cao Yin's mother, Lady Sun ( 孫氏 ), was Kangxi's wet nurse . Two years after his ascension, Kangxi appointed Cao Xueqin's great-grandfather, Cao Xi ( 曹璽 ), as the Commissioner of Imperial Textiles ( 織造 ) in Jiangning (present-day Nanjing), and the family relocated there. When Cao Xi died in 1684, Cao Yin, as Kangxi's personal confidant, took over the post. Cao Yin was one of the era's most prominent men of letters and a keen book collector. Jonathan Spence notes the strong Manchu element in the lives of these Imperial Household bond servants.
