Chilean poet and diplomat (1904–1973) In this Spanish name , the first or paternal surname is Reyes and the second or maternal family name is Basoalto . Pablo Neruda ( / n ə ˈ r uː d ə / nə- ROO -də ; Spanish pronunciation: [ˈpaβlo neˈɾuða] ⓘ ; born Ricardo Eliécer Neftalí Reyes Basoalto ; 12 July 1904 – 23 September 1973) was a Chilean poet-diplomat and politician who won the 1971 Nobel Prize in Literature . Neruda became known as a poet when he was 13 years old and wrote in a variety of styles, including surrealist poems, historical epics , political manifestos , a prose autobiography, and passionate love poems such as the ones in his collection Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair (1924). Neruda occupied many diplomatic positions in various countries during his lifetime and served a term as a senator for the Chilean Communist Party . When President Gabriel González Videla outlawed communism in Chile in 1948, a warrant was issued for Neruda's arrest. Friends hid him for months, and in 1949 he escaped through a mountain pass near Maihue Lake into Argentina; he would not return to Chile for more than three years. He was a close advisor to Chile's socialist president Salvador Allende , and when he went back to Chile after accepting his Nobel Prize in Stockholm , Allende invited him to read at the Estadio Nacional before 70,000 people. Neruda was hospitalized with cancer in September 1973, at the time of the coup d'état led by Augusto Pinochet that overthrew Allende's government, but returned home after a few days when he suspected a doctor of injecting him with an unknown substance for the purpose of murdering him on Pinochet's orders. Neruda died at his home in Isla Negra on 23 September 1973, just hours after leaving the hospital.
