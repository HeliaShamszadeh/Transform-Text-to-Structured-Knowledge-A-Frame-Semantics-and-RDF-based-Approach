English novelist and poet (1820–1849) Anne Brontë ( / ˈ b r ɒ n t i / , commonly /- t eɪ / ; 17 January 1820 – 28 May 1849) was an English novelist and poet, the youngest member of the Brontë literary family . Anne Brontë was the daughter of Maria ( née Branwell) and Patrick Brontë , a poor Irish clergyman in the Church of England . Anne lived most of her life with her family at the parish of Haworth on the Yorkshire Dales. Otherwise, she attended a boarding school in Mirfield between 1836 and 1837, and between 1839 and 1845 lived elsewhere working as a governess. In 1846, she published a book of poems with her sisters and later two novels, initially under the pen name Acton Bell. Her first novel, Agnes Grey , was published in 1847 at the same time as Wuthering Heights by her sister Emily Brontë . Anne's second novel, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall , was published in 1848. The Tenant of Wildfell Hall is often considered one of the first feminist novels. Anne died at 29, most likely of pulmonary tuberculosis . After her death, her sister Charlotte edited Agnes Grey to fix issues with its first edition, but prevented republication of The Tenant of Wildfell Hall . As a result, Anne is not as well known as her sisters. Nonetheless, both of her novels are considered classics of English literature . Anne, from a group portrait by her brother Branwell Anne's father was Patrick Brontë . Patrick Brontë was born in a two-room cottage in Emdale, Loughbrickland , County Down, Ireland. He was the oldest of ten children born to Hugh Brunty and Eleanor McCrory, poor Irish peasant farmers. The family surname, mac Aedh Ó Proinntigh , was Anglicised as Prunty or Brunty. Struggling against poverty, Patrick learned to read and write, and from 1798 taught others. In 1802, at 25, he won a place to study theology at St. John's College, Cambridge . Here he changed his name, Brunty, to the more distinguished sounding Brontë. In 1807, he was ordained in the priesthood in the Church of England.
