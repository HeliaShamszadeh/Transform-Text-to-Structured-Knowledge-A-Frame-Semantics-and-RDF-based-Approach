In 2012, Mo was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for his work as a writer "who with hallucinatory realism merges folk tales, history and the contemporary". Donald Morrison of TIME referred to him as "one of the most famous, oft-banned and widely pirated of all Chinese writers ", and Jim Leach called him the Chinese answer to Franz Kafka or Joseph Heller . He is best known to Western readers for his 1986 novel Red Sorghum , the first two parts of which were adapted into the Golden Bear -winning film Red Sorghum (1988). Mo won the 2005 International Nonino Prize in Italy. In 2009, he was the first recipient of the University of Oklahoma's Newman Prize for Chinese Literature . Biography Mo Yan was born in February 1955 into a peasant family in Ping'an Village, Gaomi Township, northeast of Shandong Province , the People's Republic of China. He is the youngest of four children with two older brothers and an older sister. His family was of an upper-middle peasant class background. Mo was 11 years old when the Cultural Revolution was launched, at which time he left school to work as a farmer. In the autumn of 1973, he began work at the cotton oil processing factory. During this period, which coincided with a succession of political campaigns from the Great Leap Forward to the Cultural Revolution , his access to literature was largely limited to novels in the socialist realist style under Mao Zedong, which centred largely on the themes of class struggle and conflict. At the close of the Cultural Revolution in 1976, Mo enlisted in the People's Liberation Army (PLA), and began writing while he was still a soldier.
