Austrian and Czech writer (1883–1924) "Kafka" redirects here. For other uses, see Kafka (disambiguation) . Franz Kafka [ b ] (3 July 1883 – 3 June 1924) was a German-language Jewish Czech writer and novelist born in Prague , in the Austro-Hungarian Empire . Widely regarded as a major figure of 20th-century literature , his work fuses elements of realism and the fantastique , and typically features isolated protagonists facing bizarre or surreal predicaments and incomprehensible socio- bureaucratic powers. The term Kafkaesque has entered the lexicon to describe situations like those depicted in his writings. His best-known works include the novella The Metamorphosis (1915) and the novels The Trial (1924) and The Castle (1926). His work has widely influenced artists, philosophers, composers, filmmakers, literary historians, religious scholars, cultural theorists. Kafka was born into a middle-class German- and Yiddish -speaking Czech Jewish family in Prague, the capital of the Kingdom of Bohemia , which belonged to the Austro-Hungarian Empire (later the capital of Czechoslovakia and the Czech Republic ). He trained as a lawyer, and after completing his legal education was employed full-time in various legal and insurance jobs. His professional obligations led to internal conflict as he felt that his true vocation was writing. Only a minority of his works were published during his life; the story-collections Contemplation (1912) and A Country Doctor (1919), and individual stories, such as his novella The Metamorphosis , were published in literary magazines, but they received little attention. He wrote hundreds of letters to family and close friends, including his father, with whom he had a strained and formal relationship. He became engaged to several women but never married. He died relatively unknown in 1924 of tuberculosis , aged 40. Though Kafka is most famous for his novels and short stories, he is also celebrated for his brief fables and aphorisms.
