Japanese writer and Nobel Laureate (1935–2023) Ōe at the Japanisches Kulturinstitut in Cologne on 11 April 2008 Kenzaburō Ōe ( 大江 健三郎 , Ōe Kenzaburō ; 31 January 1935 – 3 March 2023) was a Japanese writer and a major figure in contemporary Japanese literature . His novels, short stories and essays, strongly influenced by French and American literature and literary theory , deal with political, social and philosophical issues, including nuclear weapons , nuclear power , social non-conformism , and existentialism . Ōe was awarded the 1994 Nobel Prize in Literature for creating "an imagined world, where life and myth condense to form a disconcerting picture of the human predicament today". Born on the island of Shikoku , Ōe was from Ōse, a village that is now part of Uchiko, in Ehime Prefecture. The third of seven children, he grew up listening to his grandmother, a storyteller of myths and folklore, who also recounted the oral history of the two uprisings in the region before and after the Meiji Restoration . His father, Kōtare Ōe, had a bark-stripping business; the bark was used to make paper currency. After his father died in the Pacific War in 1944, his mother, Koseki, became the driving force behind his education, buying him books including The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and The Wonderful Adventures of Nils , which had a formative influence on him. Ōe received the first ten years of his education in local public schools. He started school during the peak of militarism in Japan ; in class, he was forced to pronounce his loyalty to Emperor Hirohito , who his teacher claimed was a god. After the war, he realized he had been taught lies and felt betrayed. This sense of betrayal later appeared in his writing. Ōe attended high school in Matsuyama from 1951 to 1953, where he excelled as a student. At the age of 18, he made his first trip to Tokyo, where he studied at a prep school ( yobikō ) for one year.
