American writer and social activist (1901–1967) For other uses, see Langston Hughes (disambiguation) . James Mercer Langston Hughes (February 1, 1901 – May 22, 1967) was an American poet, social activist, novelist, playwright, and columnist from Joplin, Missouri . An early innovator of jazz poetry , Hughes is best known as a leader of the Harlem Renaissance . Growing up in the Midwest , Hughes became a prolific writer at an early age. He moved to New York City as a young man, where he made his career. He studied at Columbia University in New York City. Although he dropped out, he gained notice from New York publishers, first in The Crisis magazine and then from book publishers, subsequently becoming known in the Harlem creative community. His first poetry collection, The Weary Blues , was published in 1926. Hughes eventually graduated from Lincoln University . In addition to poetry, Hughes wrote plays and published short story collections, novels, and several nonfiction works. From 1942 to 1962, as the civil rights movement gained traction, Hughes wrote an in-depth weekly opinion column in a leading black newspaper, The Chicago Defender . Ancestry and childhood Like many African-Americans, Hughes was of mixed ancestry. Both of Hughes's paternal great-grandmothers were enslaved Africans, and both of his paternal great-grandfathers were white slave owners in Kentucky. According to Hughes, one of these men was Sam Clay, a Scottish-American whiskey distiller of Henry County , said to be a relative of statesman Henry Clay . The other putative paternal ancestor whom Hughes named was Silas Cushenberry, a slave trader of Clark County , who Hughes claimed to be Jewish . Hughes's maternal grandmother, Mary Patterson , was of African-American, French, English and Native American descent. One of the first women to attend Oberlin College , she married Lewis Sheridan Leary , also of mixed-race descent, before her studies.
