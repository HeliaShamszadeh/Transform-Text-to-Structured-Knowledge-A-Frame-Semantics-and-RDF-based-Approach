American writer and poet (1819–1891) Herman Melville ( born Melvill ; [ a ] August 1, 1819 – September 28, 1891) was an American novelist , short story writer, and poet of the American Renaissance period. Among his best-known works are Moby-Dick (1851); Typee (1846), a romanticized account of his experiences in Polynesia ; and Billy Budd, Sailor , a posthumously published novella . At the time of his death Melville was not well known to the public, but 1919, the centennial of his birth, was the starting point of a Melville revival . Moby-Dick would eventually be considered one of the Great American Novels . Melville was born in New York City, the third child of a prosperous merchant whose death in 1832 left the family in dire financial straits. He took to sea in 1839 as a common sailor on the merchant ship St. Lawrence and then, in 1841, on the whaler Acushnet , but he jumped ship in the Marquesas Islands . Typee , his first book, and its sequel, Omoo (1847), were travel-adventures based on his encounters with the peoples of the islands. Their success gave him the financial security to marry Elizabeth Shaw, the daughter of the Boston jurist Lemuel Shaw . Mardi (1849), a romance-adventure and his first book not based on his own experience, was not well received. Redburn (1849) and White-Jacket (1850), both tales based on his experience as a well-born young man at sea, were given respectable reviews, but did not sell well enough to support his expanding family. Melville's growing literary ambition showed in Moby-Dick (1851), which took nearly a year and a half to write, but it did not find an audience, and critics scorned his psychological novel Pierre: or, The Ambiguities (1852). From 1853 to 1856, Melville published short fiction in magazines, including " Benito Cereno " and " Bartleby, the Scrivener ". In 1857, he traveled to England, toured the Near East , and published his last work of prose, The Confidence-Man (1857).
