American novelist, literary critic, scholar and writer (1913–1994) Not to be confused with Ralph Waldo Emerson . Ralph Waldo Ellison (March 1, 1913 [ a ] – April 16, 1994) was an American writer, literary critic , and scholar best known for his novel Invisible Man , which won the National Book Award in 1953. Ellison wrote Shadow and Act (1964), a collection of political, social, and critical essays, and Going to the Territory (1986). The New York Times dubbed him "among the gods of America's literary Parnassus ". A posthumous novel, Juneteenth , was published after being assembled from voluminous notes Ellison left upon his death. Ralph Waldo Ellison, named after Ralph Waldo Emerson , was born in Oklahoma City , Oklahoma, to Lewis Alfred Ellison and Ida Millsap, on March 1, 1913. He was the second of three sons; firstborn Alfred died in infancy, and younger brother Herbert Maurice (or Millsap) was born in 1916. Lewis Alfred Ellison, a small-business owner and a construction foreman, died in 1916, after work-related injury and a failed operation. The elder Ellison loved literature, and doted on his children. Ralph later discovered, as an adult, that his father had hoped he would grow up to be a poet. In 1921, Ellison's mother and her children moved to Gary, Indiana , where she had a brother. According to Ellison, his mother felt that "my brother and I would have a better chance of reaching manhood if we grew up in the north." When she did not find a job and her brother lost his, the family returned to Oklahoma, where Ellison worked as a busboy, a shoeshine boy, hotel waiter, and a dentist's assistant. From the father of a neighborhood friend, he received free lessons for playing trumpet and alto saxophone, and would go on to become the school bandmaster. Ida remarried three times after Lewis died.
