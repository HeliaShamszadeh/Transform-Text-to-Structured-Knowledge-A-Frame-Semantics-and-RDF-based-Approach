Kimitake Hiraoka ( 平岡 公威 , Hiraoka Kimitake ; 14 January 1925 – 25 November 1970), known by his pen name Yukio Mishima [ a ] ( 三島 由紀夫 , Mishima Yukio ), was a Japanese author, poet, playwright, actor, model, Shintoist , ultranationalist , and the leader of an attempted coup d'état that culminated in his seppuku (ritual suicide). Mishima is considered one of the most important postwar stylists of the Japanese language . He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature five times in the 1960s—including in 1968, when the award went to his countryman and benefactor Yasunari Kawabata . Mishima's works include the novels Confessions of a Mask and The Temple of the Golden Pavilion , and the autobiographical essay Sun and Steel . Mishima's work is characterized by "its luxurious vocabulary and decadent metaphors, its fusion of traditional Japanese and modern Western literary styles, and its obsessive assertions of the unity of beauty, eroticism and death", according to the author Andrew Rankin. Mishima's political activities made him a controversial figure; he remains so in Japan to the present day. From his mid-30s onwards, Mishima's far-right ideology and reactionary beliefs became increasingly evident. He extolled the traditional culture and spirit of Japan, and opposed what he saw as Western -style materialism , along with Japan's postwar democracy , globalism , and communism , worrying that by embracing these ideas the Japanese people would lose their "national essence" ( kokutai ) and distinctive cultural heritage to become a "rootless" people. In 1968, Mishima formed the Tatenokai ("Shield Society"), a private militia, for the purpose of protecting the dignity of the emperor as a symbol of national identity.
