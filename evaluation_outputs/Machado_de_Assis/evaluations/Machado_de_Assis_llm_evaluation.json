      "reason": "The year 1908 is explicitly stated as part of Machado de Assis's lifespan (21 June 1839 â€“ 29 September 1908). The subject 'Machado' is a reasonable reference to the main subject of the paragraph, Machado de Assis."

      "reason": "The paragraph includes the lifespan '(21 June 1839 â€“ 29 September 1908)' for Machado de Assis. While 'Assis' alone is ambiguous, it's part of his full name and 1908 is the year of his death, which is a form of 'being named' in a temporal context."
