The paragraph states 'The Prelude' is a semi-autobiographical poem of his early years, but the parents are mentioned in the context of his birth, not as a theme of the poem itself.

The paragraph mentions Cockermouth as Wordsworth's birthplace and separately mentions he was the 'second of five children'. There is no semantic relationship between the town and the number of children; this is a spurious connection."
