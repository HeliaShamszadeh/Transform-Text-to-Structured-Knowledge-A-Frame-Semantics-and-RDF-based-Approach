      "extractable": true,
      "confidence": 0.6,
      "reason": "The paragraph states Hughes 'gained notice from New York publishers, first in The Crisis magazine'. While 'Crisis' is a publication and not a location, the predicate 'has_location' could be loosely interpreted as 'has_publication_in' or 'appeared_in', making the connection semantically related."

      "confidence": 0.1,
      "reason": "The subject (Demographics_of_Africa) is completely unrelated to the paragraph. The object ('Both of Hughes's paternal great-grandmothers') is mentioned, but there is no semantic connection to the subject or the predicate 'has_student' in an educational context."

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.4,
      "reason": "The paragraph states 'Hughes eventually graduated from Lincoln University'. The subject is the university, and the object 'eventually' is directly connected to the graduation event. The predicate 'has_time' is a very weak but semantically plausible extraction from the adverb modifying the graduation."

      "extractable": true,
      "confidence": 0.5,
      "reason": "Hughes is called 'a leader of the Harlem Renaissance' and his first poetry collection was published in 1926. There is an indirect temporal connection between the Harlem Renaissance (the subject) and the year 1926 (the object) via Hughes's publication during that period."

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.0,

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.0,
