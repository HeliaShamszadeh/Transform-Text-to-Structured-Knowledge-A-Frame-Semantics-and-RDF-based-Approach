      "reason": "The phrase 'few English novels' appears in a quote about Middlemarch, a novel by George Eliot.

      "confidence": 0.6,
      "reason": "Thomas Hardy is mentioned as a writer who, like George Eliot, 'emerged from provincial England.' While not explicitly called a 'man,' the context (being a named historical figure and a contemporary of Charles Dickens) makes it a reasonable inference that he is an adult male. The paragraph also mentions a 'man much younger' in a different context, reinforcing the concept."

      "reason": "The paragraph mentions 'Agnes Jervis' and states that George Henry Lewes 'supported their children'. While the first name is different ('Jake' vs 'Agnes'), the surname 'Jervis' and the theme of 'children' are directly present, suggesting a possible extraction error rather than a complete lack of connection."
