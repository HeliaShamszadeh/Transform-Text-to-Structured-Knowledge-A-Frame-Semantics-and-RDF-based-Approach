      "reason": "Thomas Mann won the Nobel Prize, and the paragraph describes his novels as being 'noted for their insight'. There is a weak semantic link that his famous novels are related to his Nobel Prize fame."

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.0,
      "reason": "The paragraph states Mann died in 1955 and won the Nobel Prize in 1929. There is no direct or indirect connection between the Nobel Prize itself and the year 1955."

      "extractable": true,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "reason": "The phrase 'When Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, Mann fled to Switzerland' provides a clear temporal connection between the fleeing event and the year 1933."

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.0,
      "reason": "Arthur Schopenhauer is mentioned as an intellectual influence on Mann's writing. The liquidation of his father's trading firm is a separate, unrelated event. There is no semantic connection between Schopenhauer and the trading firm, especially not a 'killing' theme."

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.3,
      "reason": "The paragraph mentions Erika Mann as a child of Thomas Mann, and also mentions his older brother Heinrich. While the triple's specific relationship 'has_theme brother' is vague and not directly stated between Erika and a brother, there is a weak semantic connection through the family structure."

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.4,
      "reason": "The paragraph states Thomas Mann was a 'Nobel Prize laureate'. The triple's relationship 'People:has_person people' is very generic, but it can be loosely interpreted as the Nobel Prize being associated with a person (Thomas Mann). The connection is weak due to the vagueness of the predicate."

      "confidence": 0.6,
      "reason": "The paragraph states Mann used 'modernized versions of... the ideas of... Arthur Schopenhauer'. This provides a semantic link between Schopenhauer and the concept of being 'modernized', even if the triple's structure is awkward."

      "extractable": true,
      "confidence": 0.7,
      "reason": "The paragraph mentions 'hanseatic Mann family' and that Mann 'was born to a hanseatic family'. This creates a clear, though indirect, connection between the Hanseatic League (as the referent for 'hanseatic') and the Mann family."

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.3,
      "reason": "Schopenhauer is mentioned as one of the thinkers whose ideas Mann used. The paragraph also mentions 'writers' multiple times in relation to Mann and his family. The triple's intended meaning is unclear, but a very weak semantic connection exists through the shared context of intellectual figures and writers."

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.1,
      "reason": "The predicate 'has_creator' and object 'artist' do not align with the relationship described. The paragraph states Thomas Mann *received* the Nobel Prize; it does not suggest the prize 'has' him as a creator. The semantic connection is extremely weak and conceptually inverted."

      "extractable": true,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "reason": "The paragraph explicitly states 'When Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933', which directly connects the entity Adolf Hitler to the year 1933 in the context of a leadership event ('came to power'). The semantic connection is strong."

      "extractable": true,
      "confidence": 0.6,
      "reason": "The relationship is inverted. The paragraph states Mann used 'the ideas of... Arthur Schopenhauer', meaning Mann's work has Schopenhauer as a theme/influence, not the other way around. However, a lenient interpretation acknowledges a semantic connection between the two entities, albeit with an incorrect predicate direction."

      "triple": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erika_Mann Cardinal_numbers:has_entity Mann's six children",
      "extractable": true,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "reason": "Erika Mann is explicitly named as one of 'Mann's six children'. This establishes a clear 'part-of' or 'member-of' relationship between the individual (Erika Mann) and the group (Mann's six children), which can be leniently mapped to the 'has_entity' predicate."

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.1,
      "reason": "The triple is incoherent. The object 'writers' is a general class, not a specific entity. The paragraph states Schopenhauer was a source of ideas *for* the writer Thomas Mann, not that Schopenhauer himself 'has_author writers'. The semantic connection is invalid."

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.1,
      "reason": "The paragraph mentions 'Thomas Mann (disambiguation)' as a reference for other people with the same name, but it does not state or imply that the Nobel Prize has this disambiguation page as a theme. The connection is extremely weak and indirect."

      "extractable": true,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "reason": "The paragraph begins by identifying Thomas Mann with the dates '(1875â€“1955)', and his death year (1955) is mentioned again later. While 'Being_named' is a vague frame, the temporal association of the person with the year 1955 is clearly present."

      "reason": "The paragraph states Mann won the Nobel Prize and, in the next sentence, mentions that his novels 'are noted for their insight into the psychology of the artist and the intellectual.' While not explicitly causal, a lenient reading allows for a connection between the prize and the noted qualities of his work."

      "confidence": 0.4,
      "reason": "The paragraph states 'Mann fled to Switzerland.' While this refers to Thomas Mann, not Erika Mann, Erika is mentioned as his child. A very lenient, indirect interpretation could be that the family's move involved Erika. The connection is weak but semantically related to the theme of the triple."

      "extractable": true,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "reason": "Erika Mann is explicitly mentioned as a child of Thomas Mann. The entire paragraph is about Thomas Mann, so any mention of Erika is inherently connected to him. The 'Motion:has_theme' relationship, while vague, is reasonably supported by this familial and contextual link."

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.1,

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.3,
      "reason": "The connection is extremely weak and indirect. Schopenhauer is mentioned as one of the thinkers whose ideas Mann used. The word 'that' is a common pronoun, and its thematic link to Schopenhauer is tenuous at best, but a lenient interpretation allows for a minimal semantic connection to the theme of ideas referenced in the past."

      "reason": "Thomas Mann is stated to be the 1929 Nobel Prize laureate, and his death year is 1955. While the prize was awarded in 1929, the year 1955 is a significant date associated with his life and, by extension, his status as a Nobel laureate. A lenient, thematic interpretation supports a connection."

      "reason": "The paragraph states that Mann fled into exile when Hitler came to power, and that he is known for 'Exilliteratur' (exile literature) written in opposition to the Hitler regime. This creates a strong thematic link between Hitler and exile."
