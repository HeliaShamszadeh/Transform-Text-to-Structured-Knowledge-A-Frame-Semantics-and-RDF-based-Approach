      "reason": "The paragraph states Dante's depictions provided inspiration for Western art and literature. While 'La Vita Nuova' is mentioned, the 'theme' of inspiring art is more directly attributed to his depictions of Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven. The connection is weak and indirect."

      "reason": "The paragraph states that Dante's work 'set a precedent that important Italian writers such as Petrarch and Boccaccio would later follow.' While the event of 'following' is attributed to the writers, not the 'Middle Ages', the event occurs within that time period, creating a weak but valid semantic connection."

      "reason": "The triple's structure suggests 'La Vita Nuova' has a theme of 'Dante Alighieri,' which is semantically odd (a work's theme is typically a concept, not a person). The paragraph mentions Dante authored 'The New Life' (La Vita Nuova), but this is the inverse relationship (author has work). The intended relationship is not supported."
