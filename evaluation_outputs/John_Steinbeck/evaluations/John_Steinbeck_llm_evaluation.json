      "reason": "The paragraph states Steinbeck's 'works frequently explored the themes of fate and injustice'. While the predicate 'has_theme works' is awkwardly phrased, the semantic connection between Steinbeck, his works, and their themes is clearly present, justifying a lenient interpretation."

      "confidence": 0.4,
      "reason": "The paragraph discusses Steinbeck's literary works, canon, and themes. While 'Cannery Row' itself is not explicitly stated to have a 'literary' theme, the entire context is literary. This is a weak but valid connection under lenient rules."

      "reason": "The paragraph mentions the death of Steinbeck's grandfather's brother in Palestine in 1913. While not a direct 'killing' event, the context of 'Arab attackers killed his brother' in Palestine around 1913 provides a weak semantic connection."

      "reason": "The paragraph states 'The Grapes of Wrath... is considered Steinbeck's masterpiece and part of the American literary canon.'
