      "confidence": 0.0,
      "reason": "The triple is syntactically incomplete and semantically incoherent ('has_cause which'). The paragraph mentions Cao Xueqin was born to a Han Chinese clan, but no causation related to 'Han Chinese' is discussed."

      "extractable": true,

      "reason": "The paragraph mentions Cao Yin as Cao Xueqin's grandfather. The predicate 'People:has_person' is very general, and a clear person-to-person relationship is described."

      "reason": "The paragraph states that after the Plain White Banner was put under the emperor's jurisdiction, Cao's family began to serve in civil positions. This implies a change in activity for the family, which is semantically connected to Cao Xueqin's lineage and context."

      "reason": "While 'Han Chinese' and 'era' are both mentioned in the paragraph, they are not connected in a way that supports this triple. 'Han Chinese' describes Cao Xueqin's clan, and 'era' appears in the phrase 'one of the era's most prominent men'. There is no semantic link between the two concepts as stated in the triple."

      "reason": "The entity 'Jiankang' is not mentioned in the paragraph. The text mentions 'Jiangning (present-day Nanjing)', but 'Jiankang' is a different historical name for Nanjing. Even with a lenient interpretation, the connection is too tenuous as the triple specifies 'Jiankang' and the theme 'family' is not directly associated with the place in the text."

      "reason": "The paragraph states Cao's clan was brought into service 'in the late 1610s'. While 'late' is a temporal qualifier for the event, its direct thematic link to 'Han_Chinese' is indirect, as it describes the time of an action involving the clan."
