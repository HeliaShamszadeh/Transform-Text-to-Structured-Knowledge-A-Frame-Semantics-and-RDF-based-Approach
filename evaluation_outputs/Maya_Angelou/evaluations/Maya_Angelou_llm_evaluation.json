      "reason": "The paragraph mentions she had a 'string of odd jobs during her young adulthood' in the context of her life in the United States. This is a very weak and indirect connection, but the theme is present in the narrative about an American."

      "reason": "Maya Angelou, an American, received many awards and honors. While not explicitly stated that the 'United States' was the giver, the context implies these recognitions occurred within the US, creating a plausible semantic connection for a receiving event."

      "reason": "The connection is very indirect. The paragraph mentions Angelou worked at Wake Forest University and also that she was a 'spokesperson for Black people' and her works defended 'Black culture'.

The paragraph mentions 'attempts have been made to ban her books from some U.S. libraries' (prohibiting) and separately mentions Wake Forest University. There is no direct link stated between the university and the banning, but both concepts appear in the text, creating a very tenuous thematic connection."
