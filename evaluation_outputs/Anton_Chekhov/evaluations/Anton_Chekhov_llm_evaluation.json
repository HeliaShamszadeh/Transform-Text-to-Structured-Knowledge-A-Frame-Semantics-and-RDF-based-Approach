      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.1,
      "reason": "The word 'subsequently' appears in the text, but it refers to the Moscow Art Theatre's actions after 1898, which are related to Chekhov, not Ibsen. There is no connection to Ibsen."

      "reason": "The paragraph mentions Chekhov's plays offer a 'theatre of mood' in place of 'conventional action'.

      "confidence": 0.6,
      "reason": "The paragraph states Chekhov 'made formal innovations' in his short stories. The triple's predicate 'has_theme formal' is a reasonable, though not exact, semantic match for the concept of 'formal innovations' which were a theme of his creative work."
