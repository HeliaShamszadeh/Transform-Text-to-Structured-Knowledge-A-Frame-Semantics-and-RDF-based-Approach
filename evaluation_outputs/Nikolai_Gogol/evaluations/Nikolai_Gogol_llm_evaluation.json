      "confidence": 0.6,
      "reason": "While 'The Nose' is mentioned as one of Gogol's works, and the paragraph discusses the 'reader' in the context of his technique (defamiliarization), the specific connection of the opera version having a theme related to a 'reader' is a weak but semantically plausible extension."

      "extractable": true,
      "confidence": 0.6,
      "reason": "Gogol's Ukrainian upbringing, culture and folklore are explicitly mentioned as influencing his early works, and since Gogol was of Ukrainian origin within the East Slavic cultural sphere, this represents a reasonable thematic connection."
