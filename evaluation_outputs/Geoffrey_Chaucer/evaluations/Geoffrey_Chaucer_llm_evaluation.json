      "reason": "Westminster Abbey is mentioned as the location of Poets' Corner where Chaucer was buried. While the paragraph lists his 'other works', there is no direct statement that the Abbey has these works as a theme.

      "reason": "This is similar to the first triple. Westminster Abbey is mentioned, and 'his other works' are listed. The connection is extremely weak and indirect, but based on leniency, the co-occurrence of the subject (Abbey) and the object (his works) in the same context about the author allows for a minimal semantic link."

      "reason": "Chaucer, an English poet, died in 1400. The triple connects England to the time of a death.

      "reason": "The phrase 'one capable of finding poetic matter in English' is a direct quote describing Chaucer. The paragraph states he was crucial in legitimising Middle English in England. There is a clear thematic link between England and the concept described in the object, though the predicate 'has_type' is a very abstract fit."

      "reason": "Westminster Abbey and Geoffrey Chaucer are both mentioned, with the Abbey being his burial place. The predicate 'Change_of_leadership:has_theme' is a very poor match, but a lenient interpretation could see the burial as a significant event (a 'change') relating Chaucer to the Abbey, creating a weak semantic connection."

      "reason": "The paragraph states that Chaucer's father, John Chaucer, was 'an important wine merchant with a royal appointment.'
