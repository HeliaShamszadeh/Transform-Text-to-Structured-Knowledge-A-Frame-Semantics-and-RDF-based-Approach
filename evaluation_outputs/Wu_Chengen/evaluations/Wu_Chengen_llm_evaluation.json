      "reason": "The paragraph states that Wu Rui 'devote[d] himself to literary pursuits'. While the subject URI is for a eunuch and the text refers to Wu Cheng'en's father, the activity phrase is a direct match. Being lenient, the semantic connection to the activity is valid."

      "reason": "The paragraph mentions Wu Rui as Wu Cheng'en's father, but there is no connection between the Ming Dynasty and a eunuch named Wu Rui. The Wu Rui mentioned is an artisan, not a eunuch, and the 'Kinship' theme is not applicable to the dynasty itself."

      "reason": "The paragraph states that Wu Rui (Wu Cheng'en's father) became an artisan due to 'his family's financial difficulties'. This event occurred during the Ming dynasty. The connection is very weak and indirect, as the financial difficulties are not a cause of the dynasty's existence, but the concepts are co-mentioned in a historical context."
