      "reason": "The triple's relationship 'Receiving:has_location Literature' is semantically incoherent.

      "reason": "The paragraph describes Hemingway's direct, personal experience serving as an ambulance driver and being wounded on the Italian Front in WWI.

The paragraph states Hemingway's 'experiences during the war supplied material for his 1929 novel A Farewell to Arms'.
