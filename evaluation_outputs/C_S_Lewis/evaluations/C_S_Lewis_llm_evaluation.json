      "reason": "The paragraph mentions Lewis held a position at Oxford for a duration of years (1925-1954). While the connection is weak and the predicate is vague, the theme of 'years' as a measure of duration is indirectly related to his time at the university."

      "reason": "The year 1963 is mentioned as the year Lewis died and the end of his tenure at Cambridge. While the University of Oxford is mentioned in the context of his career, the specific year 1963 is not directly linked to an event at Oxford, but there is a weak temporal connection via the subject's life."

      "reason": "The phrase 'Both men' refers to Lewis and Tolkien, who 'served on the English faculty at the University of Oxford.' The frame 'Being_incarcerated' is a very poor semantic match for 'served on the faculty,' but a lenient interpretation could see a weak thematic link of 'being associated with' an institution."
