      "confidence": 0.1,
      "reason": "The triple refers to a newspaper called 'The Stranger' having a theme of 'world', but the paragraph mentions 'The Stranger' as a literary work by Camus, not a newspaper. The concept of 'world' appears in the text (e.g., 'world federalist', 'lectures around the world'), but not in a thematic connection to a newspaper named The Stranger."

      "confidence": 0.6,
      "reason": "The paragraph states Camus was 'part of many organisations' and that he 'opposed Joseph Stalin'. While the triple is awkwardly phrased, there is a semantic connection between Stalin and organizations through Camus's political activism and organizational memberships mentioned in the text."

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.4,
      "reason": "The paragraph mentions 'Camus (disambiguation)' in the context of the Wikipedia article structure, and France is prominently featured throughout the text as Camus's nationality and the location of key events. While the connection is weak and structural rather than content-based, there is a semantic link through the document context."

      "extractable": true,
      "confidence": 0.7,
      "reason": "The paragraph connects Stalin to the political left by stating Camus was 'part of the left that opposed Joseph Stalin', implying Stalin exists in relation to the left political spectrum as an opposition figure, creating a reasonable semantic connection."

      "extractable": true,
      "confidence": 0.7,

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.1,
      "reason": "The triple is semantically incoherent and unrelated to the paragraph. 'The Stranger' in the paragraph refers to a novel by Camus, not a newspaper. The concept of 'their totalitarianism' refers to Camus's opposition to the Soviet Union, but there is no causal link stated or implied to 'The Stranger'."

      "reason": "The paragraph states 'He was in Paris when the Germans invaded France during World War II in 1940.' This semantically links Paris to the time of the German invasion in 1940, even if the specific relation 'Interior_profile_relation:has_time' is abstract."

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.2,
      "reason": "The subject is incorrect and the connection is very weak, but 'Sintès' is mentioned as Camus's mother's maiden name, providing a minimal semantic link to the paragraph's content."

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.1,
      "reason": "The triple is nonsensical. 'The Stranger' is a novel by Camus, not a newspaper, and it has no stated connection to 'many lectures' in the paragraph. The lectures are given by Camus himself."

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.1,
      "reason": "The triple is incoherent. 'Age:has_location' is not a standard relation, and connecting 'Albert Camus' directly to 'Literature' as a location does not reflect the information in the paragraph, which states he won the Nobel Prize in Literature."

      "extractable": true,
      "confidence": 0.6,
      "reason": "While the relation 'Kinship:has_theme' is unusual for 'childhood', the paragraph mentions Camus's childhood ('He spent his childhood...'). There is a weak but valid semantic connection as childhood is a personal life event."

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.1,
      "reason": "The relationship described is incoherent. The paragraph states Camus opposed Stalin, but the triple's predicate and object ('Respond_to_proposal:has_speaker he himself') do not form a meaningful or extractable statement from the text."

      "confidence": 0.1,
      "reason": "The subject is incorrect (it's a novel, not a newspaper). Furthermore, the predicate 'Inclusion:has_theme' does not accurately describe the relationship; the listed items are works by Camus, not themes of a single entity."

      "extractable": true,
      "confidence": 0.6,
      "reason": "The paragraph states 'He married twice,' which is a personal relationship. The predicate 'has_degree' is a weak match for the concept of marital status, but a semantic connection to the information exists."

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.3,
      "reason": "The triple is poorly formed, but the paragraph states Camus 'opposed Joseph Stalin,' creating a weak semantic link between Stalin and the theme of opposition ('that' could refer to the act of opposing)."

      "confidence": 0.7,
      "reason": "The paragraph states 'Camus tried to flee but finally joined the French Resistance where he served as editor-in-chief at Combat.' This connects 'Combat' to the temporal aspect 'finally' of him joining."

      "extractable": true,
      "confidence": 0.6,
