      "extractable": true,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "reason": "The paragraph mentions a film (To Have and Have Not) is 'the only film with contributions by two Nobel laureates' (Faulkner and Hemingway). While the triple's subject is the prize itself, the theme of 'two Nobel laureates' is semantically present in the text and associated with literature/film contributions."

      "confidence": 0.6,
      "reason": "The paragraph discusses 'American literature' and 'Southern literature'. While 'United States' is not explicitly named, 'American' is a direct synonym and the overarching theme of the literature discussed is American. This is a weak but valid semantic connection."

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.1,
      "reason": "The paragraph states that 'Two of his works, A Fable (1954) and The Reivers (1962), won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.' It explicitly mentions that 'The Sound and the Fury' was published in 1929 but does not state it won the Pulitzer Prize. The triple attributes the prize to the wrong book."

      "confidence": 0.6,
      "reason": "The paragraph states Faulkner is 'one of the most celebrated writers of American literature, often considered the greatest writer of Southern literature'. This creates a strong semantic link between 'Southern literature' and the broader category of 'American literature', even if the exact predicate 'has_text' is abstract."

      "confidence": 1.0,
      "reason": "The entire paragraph is about William Faulkner, and the possessive 'Faulkner's' is used directly in the text (e.g., 'Faulkner's reputation'). The triple's subject and object are coreferent with the main subject of the paragraph."

      "confidence": 0.4,
      "reason": "The paragraph mentions both that Faulkner 'attended the University of Mississippi' and that his 'reputation grew following publication of Malcolm Cowley's The Portable Faulkner'. While the triple connects these two facts with a specific, abstract relation ('Change_position_on_a_scale:has_time'), a weak semantic link exists as both events are part of his life timeline."

      "reason": "The paragraph discusses the Nobel Prize in Literature and mentions 'Nobel laureate' and 'laureates' in the context of winners of the prize. While 'has_leader' is a weak semantic fit for the relationship between a prize and its recipients, the concepts are present and related."

      "reason": "The paragraph mentions Faulkner as a 'Nobel laureate' who won the 'Nobel Prize in Literature'.
