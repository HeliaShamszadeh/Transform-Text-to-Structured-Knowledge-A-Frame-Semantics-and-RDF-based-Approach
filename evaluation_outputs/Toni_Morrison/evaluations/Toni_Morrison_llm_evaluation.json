      "reason": "The paragraph states Morrison's works are praised for addressing these themes. While the subject is generalized to 'African Americans' instead of Morrison's specific focus, the core concept of 'addressing the harsh consequences of racism' is directly present and can be linked thematically."

      "confidence": 0.1,
      "reason": "While the paragraph mentions 'American politician' in a 'see also' reference for a different person, the triple's subject is the United States and the predicate suggests the US is the origin of the entity 'politician'. This is too vague and indirect; the paragraph does not support this specific relationship."

      "reason": "The paragraph mentions 'the U.S. federal government's highest honor' in relation to Morrison's achievements. While 'African Americans' is not explicitly linked to 'federal' in a direct statement, the text discusses the Black American experience and federal honors, creating a weak but valid semantic connection."
