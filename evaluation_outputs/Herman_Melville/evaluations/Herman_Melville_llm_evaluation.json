      "confidence": 0.1,
      "reason": "The paragraph states Herman Melville was a poet of the American Renaissance period, but there is no semantic connection between the American Renaissance and death as a theme related to Melville. The death mentioned is his father's, not a theme of the literary period."

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.2,
      "reason": "While the paragraph mentions Melville was 'not well known' at his death and had a 'revival' starting in 1919, there is no direct or indirect connection stating that the American Renaissance period itself had a degree of fame described as 'well'."

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.3,
      "reason": "While Melville's experiences at sea are a major theme in his works (which were written during the American Renaissance period), there is no indication that the American Renaissance literary movement itself has the sea as a theme. The connection is too indirect."

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.2,
      "reason": "The paragraph mentions Melville's 'expanding family' in the context of his financial struggles, but there is no connection between this personal detail and the American Renaissance period having it as a theme. The supporting relationship is not established."

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.1,
      "reason": "The predicate 'Measure_duration:has_location' is nonsensical in this context. The paragraph states Melville was a poet of the American Renaissance period and that he wrote Moby-Dick, but there is no semantic connection suggesting the American Renaissance 'has_location' in 'Moby'."

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.1,
      "reason": "The predicate 'Judgment:has_location' is nonsensical in this context. The paragraph links Melville and his work Moby-Dick to the American Renaissance period, but it does not state or imply that the period itself has a location in the book 'Moby'."

      "extractable": true,

      "reason": "The paragraph explicitly states 'Moby-Dick would eventually be considered one of the Great American Novels'. This is a direct semantic match for the triple's intended meaning of categorization."

      "extractable": true,
      "confidence": 0.6,
      "reason": "The paragraph states 'Melville was born in New York City, the third child...'. While the triple's structure is awkward, there is a semantic connection between New York City and a 'child' (Melville) being born there."

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.1,
      "reason": "The predicate 'Taking_time:has_location' is nonsensical and does not correspond to any relationship described in the paragraph. The connection between the American Renaissance period and the book Moby-Dick is one of association (Melville was part of the period and wrote the book), not one of the period having a location within the book."

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.1,
      "reason": "The triple is semantically incoherent and does not form a meaningful statement. The relationship 'Measure_duration:has_theme year' is unclear and cannot be reasonably connected to the paragraph's content about the American Renaissance period."

      "extractable": true,
      "confidence": 0.6,
      "reason": "The paragraph mentions 'his experiences in Polynesia' as the basis for the book 'Typee'. While 'Tahitians' are a specific Polynesian people not explicitly named, there is a clear thematic connection to the broader concept of Polynesian experiences, making this a reasonable, though indirect, extraction."

      "extractable": true,
      "confidence": 0.5,
      "reason": "Melville is described as a writer 'of the American Renaissance period'. The connection between the period and the activity of writing is implied by his classification as a writer within that period, though the relationship 'Taking_time:has_activity' is not explicitly stated."

      "extractable": true,
      "confidence": 0.7,
      "reason": "The paragraph states 'Melville was born in New York City, the third child of a prosperous merchant'. This establishes a clear connection between New York City and the prosperous merchant (his father), even if the specific predicate 'Ordinal_numbers:has_theme' is an unusual way to express this relationship."

      "extractable": true,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "reason": "The paragraph states Melville was born in New York City and that his father's death was in 1832. While the death did not necessarily occur in New York City, the facts are presented in immediate sequence, creating a strong contextual link between the city, the death event, and the year."

      "reason": "The paragraph mentions Herman Melville was the son of a 'prosperous merchant' and that he was part of the 'American Renaissance period', but there is no direct or indirect semantic link suggesting the American Renaissance 'possesses' a merchant. The concepts are related to the same person but not in this specific relationship."

      "reason": "The paragraph discusses works of prose by Melville (a figure of the American Renaissance), but it does not state or imply that the American Renaissance period itself is a 'type' of 'work of prose'. The relationship is misattributed."

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.1,
      "reason": "'Moby' is an incomplete reference to 'Moby-Dick', a novel written during the American Renaissance. However, the relationship 'has_location' is nonsensical in this context. The novel is a product of the period, not located in it in a way that fits this predicate."

      "extractable": true,
      "confidence": 0.6,
      "reason": "The American Renaissance period is mentioned, and the year 1857 is explicitly stated as when Melville traveled and published his last prose work. While the connection is temporal/collocational rather than thematic, it is a reasonable, though indirect, semantic link given the lenient guidelines."

      "reason": "The phrase 'one of the Great American Novels' describes Moby-Dick, not the concept of a 'Great American Novel' itself. The triple's subject is the concept, not the book, and the predicate 'has_theme one' is semantically unclear and not supported."
