      "confidence": 0.6,
      "reason": "The paragraph states 'His poetry often focused on both loss and healing.' While this refers to his poetry in general, Leaves of Grass is his major poetry collection, making the connection semantically reasonable."

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.4,
      "reason": "The predicate is vague, but the paragraph discusses themes in Whitman's work (e.g., 'focused on both loss and healing'). As Leaves of Grass is his primary work, a weak semantic connection exists."

      "triple": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaves_of_Grass Aggregate:has_theme collection",
      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.3,
      "reason": "The predicate is unclear, but Leaves of Grass is explicitly called a 'poetry collection' and a 'major poetry collection' in the text. This is a very weak but valid semantic link to the concept of a 'collection'."

      "extractable": true,

      "extractable": true,
      "confidence": 1.0,
      "reason": "The sentence 'Whitman continued expanding and revising Leaves of Grass until his death in 1892' is a direct and exact match for the triple's meaning."

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.1,

      "extractable": true,
      "confidence": 0.6,
      "reason": "The word 'greatly' is used in the context of Whitman's admiration for Abraham Lincoln ('whom Whitman greatly admired'). While the triple structure is abstract, the concept of 'degree' (greatly) is present in the text."

      "triple": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Whitman Kinship:has_theme free verse",
      "extractable": true,

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.2,
      "reason": "The word 'formal' appears in the context of 'formal schooling,' which Whitman left at age 11. There is no direct or indirect connection between the publication 'Leaves of Grass' and a 'formal level' of education."

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.3,
      "reason": "Whitman worked as a 'teacher,' but this is a profession he held, not a role attributed to the book 'Leaves of Grass.' The connection between the book and having a teacher is tenuous and not supported by the text."

      "extractable": true,
      "confidence": 0.6,
      "reason": "The paragraph states 'financed with his own money', connecting the work 'Leaves of Grass' to the theme of money/financing, though the relationship is about funding rather than a thematic element."

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.1,
      "reason": "The relationship is inverted; Whitman is the author/creator of 'Leaves of Grass', not an employee of it. The triple suggests the work employs the person, which contradicts the semantic meaning in the paragraph."

      "extractable": true,

      "extractable": true,
      "confidence": 0.7,

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.4,
      "reason": "The paragraph states Whitman worked in hospitals caring for the wounded during the Civil War, and his poetry focused on loss and healing. While 'Leaves of Grass' is not explicitly linked to the theme of 'wounded,' the work is his major poetry collection and the broader context of his poetry's themes creates a weak semantic connection."

      "confidence": 0.1,
      "reason": "The paragraph mentions Whitman suffered a stroke, but this event is described as part of his life biography, not as a theme of 'Leaves of Grass.' There is no semantic connection between the book and the stroke."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "reason": "The paragraph explicitly states that 'Whitman's major poetry collection, Leaves of Grass' and that he 'continued expanding and revising' it. This directly supports a relationship where Whitman 'has' the item 'Leaves of Grass.'"

      "extractable": true,
      "confidence": 0.7,
      "reason": "The paragraph states 'Whitman's influence on poetry remains strong' and that one cannot understand America without him 'without Leaves of Grass.' This strongly implies that 'Leaves of Grass' is the primary vehicle for his influential theme."

      "extractable": false,

      "extractable": true,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "reason": "The paragraph states 'he also wrote two novels,' which is a direct statement about the subject's creation of textual works. The relationship 'has_text' is a reasonable semantic interpretation of 'wrote'."

      "confidence": 0.7,
      "reason": "The phrase 'Whitman's major poetry collection, Leaves of Grass' is used in the paragraph. While the predicate 'has_work' is somewhat inverted (the work 'has' the collection), the semantic connection that the subject 'Leaves of Grass' is the work in question is clearly present."

      "extractable": true,
      "confidence": 0.5,
      "reason": "The paragraph mentions 'American literature' multiple times. While the connection between the United States and literature is indirect and the triple is very abstract, the concept of American (US) literature is a central theme, providing a weak but valid semantic link."

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.1,
      "reason": "The predicate 'Judgment:has_evaluee whom' is syntactically and semantically unclear. It does not correspond to any clear relationship described in the paragraph. The word 'whom' appears once in reference to Abraham Lincoln, not in a way that forms a coherent triple with Whitman as the subject."

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.0,
      "reason": "The paragraph does not describe 'Leaves of Grass' as having a patient. The predicate 'Medical_conditions:has_patient' implies a medical relationship, which is not present between the book and the author. Whitman's health is discussed separately from his book."

      "extractable": true,

      "confidence": 0.6,
      "reason": "The paragraph states 'His poetry often focused on both loss and healing.' While this refers to his poetry in general, 'Leaves of Grass' is his major and continually revised work, making it a reasonable inference that this theme is present in it. The connection is indirect but semantically valid."

      "extractable": true,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "reason": "The paragraph states Whitman 'is often called the father of free verse'. The predicate 'Labeling:has_theme' is a stretch, but it semantically connects Whitman to the concept of being the 'father of free verse'. The connection is about a label applied to him, which is a type of thematic attribute."

      "extractable": true,
      "confidence": 0.7,
      "reason": "The paragraph states Whitman's work was controversial for its 'overt sensuality'. While the phrasing 'its overt sensuality' refers to 'Leaves of Grass', the theme is a defining characteristic of Whitman's controversial work, creating a reasonable semantic link to the author."
