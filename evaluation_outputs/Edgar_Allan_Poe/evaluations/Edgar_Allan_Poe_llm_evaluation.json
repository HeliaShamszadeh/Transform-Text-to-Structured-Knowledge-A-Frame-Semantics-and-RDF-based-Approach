      "reason": "The paragraph mentions Poe failing as an officer cadet at West Point (the United States Military Academy) and his quarrels with John Allan, but it does not state or imply that John Allan himself had a purpose or location at the Academy. The connection is too indirect and speculative."

      "reason": "The paragraph describes a relationship where John Allan took Poe in ('Poe was taken in by John and Frances Allan'). While the predicate 'Becoming:has_entity' is vague, a semantic connection of guardianship/existence exists, supporting a lenient interpretation."
