      "reason": "The paragraph states 'In 1955, he was appointed... professor of English Literature at the University of Buenos Aires.'

      "reason": "The paragraph states 'Born in Buenos Aires, Borges later moved with his family to Switzerland in 1914'. While the predicate 'Relative_time:has_theme' is an unusual and abstract way to represent this, there is a semantic connection between Buenos Aires and the event of moving away from it.
