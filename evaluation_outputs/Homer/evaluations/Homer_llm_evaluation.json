      "reason": "The date '2025' appears only in a meta-comment about the article's clarity and is completely unrelated to the content or timeline of the Iliad. There is no semantic connection."

      "extractable": true,
      "confidence": 0.5,
      "reason": "The paragraph mentions 'the last year of the Trojan War'. This establishes a direct, though syntactically different, semantic link between the Trojan War and the concept of a 'year' as a unit of time related to its theme/duration."

      "confidence": 0.1,
      "reason": "The subject 'Anno Domini' is completely unrelated to the paragraph's content about Homer. The predicate and object describe Homer's authorship, but the triple as a whole is not extractable due to the incorrect subject."

      "extractable": true,
      "confidence": 0.6,
      "reason": "There is a weak semantic connection. The paragraph states Homer was an 'ancient Greek poet' and the poems are in 'Homeric Greek.' While 'Text:has_text poet' is an abstract relationship, it can be loosely interpreted as the language (Ancient Greek) being associated with a poet."

      "reason": "The Trojan War and the 'punishment of the gods' are mentioned, but they are in separate contexts. The punishment is related to Odysseus's journey in the Odyssey, not directly to a problem within the Trojan War narrative.

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "reason": "The paragraph explicitly states 'The poems are in Homeric Greek, also known as Epic Greek, a literary language...'. This directly supports the relationship that Homeric Greek (the subject) is a language (the object). The predicate 'Fields:has_theme' is a reasonable, if slightly abstract, categorization for this 'is-a' relationship."

      "extractable": true,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "reason": "The paragraph states 'The Odyssey chronicles the ten-year journey of Odysseus, king of Ithaca, back to his home after the fall of Troy.' This establishes a strong semantic link between Ithaca (via its king) and the time period 'after the fall of Troy' in the context of a journey/travel."

      "confidence": 0.3,

      "reason": "The article mentions 'There might be a discussion about this on the talk page'. While the 'talk page' is a location for discussion about the article (which is about Homer and the Iliad), the connection to the Iliad's existence having a location is very indirect and weak, but semantically plausible in a lenient interpretation."

      "extractable": true,
      "confidence": 0.5,
      "reason": "The paragraph states 'the last year of the Trojan War'. This connects the Trojan War to the calendric concept of a 'last' year. The predicate 'has_theme' is a stretch, but a lenient interpretation accepts 'last' as a thematic element of the war's description."

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.4,
      "reason": "There is an indirect connection. The Iliad is set during the Trojan War, and the paragraph states 'the poems were originally transmitted orally'. While the oral transmission is not a theme *of* the war, the war is a theme *of* the poem whose transmission is discussed."

      "reason": "The paragraph mentions the Trojan War and states the poems are known for 'their tragic and serious themes'. There is a reasonable semantic link, as the war is a central subject of one of the poems, and the themes are a reason for the poems' fame."
