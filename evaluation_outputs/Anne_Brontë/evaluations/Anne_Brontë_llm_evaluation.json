      "extractable": true,
      "confidence": 0.6,
      "reason": "The paragraph states 'Anne lived most of her life with her family at the parish of Haworth on the Yorkshire Dales,' which connects the concept of 'most' (as a degree of likelihood or quantity) to the Yorkshire Dales in the context of the duration of her residence."

      "confidence": 0.1,
      "reason": "The triple connects 'Yorkshire Dales' to a birth event that occurred in Ireland. The paragraph mentions Anne lived in Yorkshire Dales, and her father was born in Ireland to Hugh Brunty and Eleanor McCrory, but these are two separate facts with no direct semantic link stated in the text."

      "reason": "The paragraph states Anne 'attended a boarding school in Mirfield' and later 'lived elsewhere working as a governess'. While the governess role is not explicitly linked to Mirfield, the text connects Mirfield to her life timeline, and the governess role is a key part of her employment history mentioned in the same context."

      "confidence": 0.1,
      "reason": "The paragraph mentions both 'The Tenant of Wildfell Hall' and 'study theology at St. John's College, Cambridge' but they are completely unrelated - the novel is Anne's work while the theology study refers to her father Patrick's education decades earlier. No semantic connection exists between these two elements."
