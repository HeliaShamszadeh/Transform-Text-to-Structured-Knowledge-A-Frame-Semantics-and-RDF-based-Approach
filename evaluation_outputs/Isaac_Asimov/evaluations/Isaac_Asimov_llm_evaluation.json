      "reason": "The paragraph states Asimov was part of the 'Big Three' science fiction writers along with Heinlein and Clarke. The 'Accompaniment:has_theme' predicate can be loosely interpreted as a relationship of association or shared context, which is present."

      "reason": "While the paragraph mentions 1920 as Asimov's birth year and his association with Boston University, the connection between the university's origin and 1920 is very weak and indirect, but a lenient interpretation allows for a semantic link through Asimov's biography."
