      "confidence": 0.8,
      "reason": "The paragraph explicitly states 'Twain became a much sought-after speaker.' This directly matches the subject and the object of the triple, and the predicate 'Becoming:has_theme' is a reasonable semantic match for the concept of 'becoming' something."

      "reason": "The subject is the United States, but the object 'writer, humorist, and essayist' describes Mark Twain, not the country. The relationship 'Origin:has_entity' is not supported; while Twain is an American writer, the paragraph does not state that the United States 'has' him as an entity in a way that aligns with this triple's structure."

      "confidence": 0.6,
      "reason": "The paragraph mentions Angels Camp, California as a place 'where Twain had spent some time.' This establishes a connection between the location and the concept of 'time,' making the triple semantically extractable, even if the predicate 'Proportional_quantity:has_theme' is an abstract fit."

      "reason": "The paragraph clearly states Twain was raised in Hannibal, Missouri, providing a strong location connection. However, the predicate 'Growing_food:has_location' is highly specific to an unrelated domain (agriculture), making the triple's intended meaning not extractable."

The paragraph mentions the short story brought Twain 'international attention,' which can be loosely interpreted as having an international theme or scope.
