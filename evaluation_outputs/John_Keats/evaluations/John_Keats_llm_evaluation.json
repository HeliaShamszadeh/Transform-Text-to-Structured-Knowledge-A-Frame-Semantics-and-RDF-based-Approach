      "confidence": 0.8,
      "reason": "The paragraph states Keats 'strongly influencing many writers of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood'. While 'has_theme' is not a perfect match for 'influencing', the semantic connection between a poet's work (which has themes) and his influence on other writers is reasonably extractable."

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.3,
      "reason": "The paragraph mentions his poems were in publication for 'less than four years'. This is a weak connection, as 'four' is a duration measure related to his career, but the predicate 'has_theme' is a very poor semantic fit for a unit of time."

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.4,
      "reason": "The paragraph states 'By the end of the century, he was placed in the canon...'. 'Century' is a calendric unit mentioned in the context of his posthumous fame. The connection is weak because 'has_theme' is not an appropriate predicate for a point in time, but the concept of a 'century' is present."

      "reason": "The paragraph mentions 'In the later Victorian era, Keats' medievalist poems... were a major influence'. This creates a semantic connection between Keats and the Victorian era, though the predicate 'has_theme' is a slightly abstract interpretation of his influence during that period."

      "reason": "The paragraph states 'Jorge Luis Borges named his first time reading Keats an experience he felt all his life.' While the triple's subject is John Keats and the object is 'he felt all his life', the semantic connection is indirect; the experience of reading Keats is the theme felt by Borges, not Keats himself.
