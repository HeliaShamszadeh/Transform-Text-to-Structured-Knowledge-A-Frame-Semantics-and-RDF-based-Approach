      "confidence": 0.8,
      "reason": "The paragraph states Soyinka was the editor of 'the university's magazine, The Eagle'. The relationship between the person (Soyinka) and the theme/object (the magazine) is clearly present, even if the specific property 'has_theme' is a broad interpretation."

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.1,
      "reason": "The paragraph mentions 'Government College, Ibadan', not 'Government College Umuahia'. Furthermore, while Soyinka's 'works' are discussed, there is no semantic link connecting them specifically to this incorrect college. The connection is entirely absent."

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.1,
      "reason": "The paragraph mentions 'Government College, Ibadan' and the town 'Aké, Abeokuta'. The triple refers to a different college ('Umuahia') and an incomplete/unmatched location ('Ak'). There is no reasonable semantic connection."

      "extractable": true,
      "confidence": 0.6,
      "reason": "The paragraph mentions 'the university's magazine, The Eagle'. While 'Eagle (British comics)' is a specific entity that may not be the one referenced, the text does contain the concept of a magazine named 'The Eagle'. This provides a weak but valid semantic connection to the triple's object and property."

      "extractable": true,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "reason": "Soyinka is identified as Nigerian, and the paragraph uses the word 'many' in relation to his works ('many articles and short stories', 'Many of Soyinka's novels'). This creates a reasonable, though indirect, link between Nigerians and quantity."

      "extractable": true,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "reason": "The paragraph states 'Born into an Anglican Yoruba family in Aké, Abeokuta'. The 'has_theme' relation is a reasonable, though slightly abstract, interpretation of the circumstances of his birth."

      "reason": "The paragraph states Soyinka is Nigerian and his works (novels, plays) are set in Nigeria, reflecting the country's themes. The connection between 'Nigerians' and the 'theme' of his 'works' is semantically present, though the predicate 'Translating:has_theme' is an imperfect match."

      "confidence": 0.0,
      "reason": "The paragraph mentions 'Government College, Ibadan', not 'Government College Umuahia'. The location 'Nigeria and the UK' is associated with where Soyinka's plays were performed, not with the college building. The subject is incorrect and the predicate/object combination is misattributed."

      "confidence": 0.7,
      "reason": "The paragraph states Soyinka's plays are set in Nigeria and reflect the country's history and culture. This implies Nigeria is a theme in the plays. The connection is reasonable, though the predicate 'Quantified_mass:has_theme' is abstract."

      "extractable": true,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "reason": "The paragraph directly states 'He has written... ten collections of short stories' and 'he started writing short stories'. This is a clear and direct match for the subject creating texts that are short stories."

      "extractable": true,
      "confidence": 0.6,
      "reason": "Soyinka is identified as Nigerian and his birth year (1934) is stated. The triple semantically connects 'Nigerians' to the time '1934' through the fame of a specific Nigerian, which is a lenient but reasonable interpretation."

      "reason": "The paragraph mentions Soyinka was editor of a university magazine called 'The Eagle'. While 'Eagle (British comics)' is a different entity, the semantic connection via the shared name 'Eagle' and the relationship of editorship is a weak but valid link."
