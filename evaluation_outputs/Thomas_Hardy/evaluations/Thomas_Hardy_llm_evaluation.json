      "reason": "The paragraph states that two of Hardy's novels, including Tess of the d'Urbervilles, were in a survey of 'best-loved novels'. While Jude the Obscure is not explicitly named in that specific list, it is mentioned as one of his famous novels. There is a weak but reasonable semantic connection that his works, as a category, are associated with being 'best-loved'."

      "confidence": 0.7,
      "reason": "The paragraph states Hardy was critical of the 'declining status of rural people in Britain such as those from his native South West England' within the context of 'Victorian society'. This creates a semantic link between South West England and the Victorian era, as it was a location affected by conditions during that period."

      "reason": "The paragraph states that Wordsworth's poetry was an influence on Hardy's work (a theme of 'Romanticism'). The phrase 'his death' refers to Thomas Hardy's death, not Wordsworth's, and there is no connection made between Wordsworth and the theme or event of Hardy's death."

      "confidence": 0.5,
      "reason": "The paragraph states that Hardy, a Victorian realist, was influenced by Romanticism, 'including the poetry of William Wordsworth'. This creates an indirect semantic connection, placing Wordsworth's influence within the Victorian era context, though it does not state Wordsworth was personally located in the Victorian period."

      "reason": "The novel 'Jude the Obscure' is mentioned, and a 'tree' (the Hardy Tree) is mentioned in a separate sentence about Hardy's life and career. There is no semantic connection between the specific novel and the theme of a tree; the two pieces of information are completely unrelated in the text."

      "confidence": 0.6,
      "reason": "The paragraph states Hardy was critical of the declining status of rural people, specifically mentioning those from his native South West England. The triple connects the region to the theme of rural status, which is a reasonable semantic connection."

      "reason": "The triple is incoherent. The subject is William Wordsworth, but the predicate 'Age:has_entity' and object 'poets' do not form a meaningful statement that can be extracted from the paragraph.

      "reason": "The triple is incoherent. The predicate 'Cardinal_numbers:has_entity' and object 'his novels' (presumably referring to Hardy's novels) do not form a meaningful statement about the subject, William Wordsworth.

      "reason": "The paragraph states that gravestones were moved 'while Hardy was working there' (at Old St Pancras churchyard).
