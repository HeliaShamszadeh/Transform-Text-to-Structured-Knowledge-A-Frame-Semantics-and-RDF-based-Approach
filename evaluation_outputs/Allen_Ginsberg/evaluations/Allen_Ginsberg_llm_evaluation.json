      "reason": "The paragraph states Ginsberg 'lived modestly' and resided in New York City's East Village. While 'modestly' describes his manner of living and is not directly a 'theme' of the city, there is a weak semantic connection between his residence and his modest lifestyle."

      "reason": "The paragraph mentions US Customs seizing copies of 'Howl' in relation to an obscenity trial. The seizure can be interpreted as an 'act' performed by the Customs Service, and the context of the trial gives it a thematic connection to legal/offensive acts."

      "reason": "The entire paragraph is about Allen Ginsberg, his life, work, and impact. As a prominent American poet, his story is thematically linked to the United States. The text discusses his opposition to aspects of US society and his obscenity trial, creating a strong semantic connection."
