      "reason": "The paragraph mentions 'American poet' and the year 1923 in the context of Williams's work 'Spring and All'. This is a very weak and indirect connection, as the subject is not 'American poetry' as a concept but a specific American poet."

This connects the concept of 'Little Men' to Williams's perspective or point of view on humanity."
