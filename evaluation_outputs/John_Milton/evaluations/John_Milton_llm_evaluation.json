      "confidence": 0.8,
      "reason": "Paragraph states Paradise Lost 'was written in blank verse' and that Milton was 'the first modern writer to employ unrhymed verse'. Blank verse is unrhymed iambic pentameter, making this a strong semantic match for using unrhymed verse as an instrument."

      "reason": "The paragraph attributes the theme of defending freedom of speech/press to Milton's work 'Areopagitica'. The predicate 'Be_subset_of:has_theme' is an unusual construction, but the semantic connection between Milton and this theme is strongly supported."

      "reason": "The paragraph states 'He was the first modern writer to employ unrhymed verse...' This can be interpreted as John Milton (the agent) 'using' a specific style, which is a characteristic of being the 'first modern writer' to do so.
