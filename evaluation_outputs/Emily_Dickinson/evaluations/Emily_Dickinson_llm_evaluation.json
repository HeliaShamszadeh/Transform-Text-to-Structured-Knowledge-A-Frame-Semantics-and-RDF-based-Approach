      "confidence": 0.6,
      "reason": "The paragraph states she returned to her family's home in Amherst after studying. 'Returning' implies the home was a destination/goal, though the predicate 'has_goal' is an indirect match."

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.1,
      "reason": "The paragraph discusses themes of Dickinson's poetry (death, immortality, etc.), but 'family' is not listed as a theme. The text mentions her own family, but not as a theme of American poetry itself. The connection is too tenuous."

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.4,
      "reason": "The paragraph states a 'complete collection' of her poetry became available in 1955. While 'complete' describes a collection of her work (which is part of American poetry), the connection to American poetry as a whole having the theme 'complete' is very weak and indirect."

      "confidence": 0.1,
      "reason": "The triple is semantically incoherent and does not correspond to any information or logical relationship in the paragraph. 'Using:has_theme often' is not a meaningful assertion about American poetry found in the text."

      "reason": "While the paragraph mentions Dickinson's 'reluctance to greet guests,' this is a personal characteristic of the poet, not a theme of American poetry itself. The connection is too tenuous and indirect to be reasonably extracted."

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.1,
      "reason": "The relationship 'Resolve_problem:has_cause' implies a problem-solution dynamic. The paragraph describes themes of her poems but does not suggest American poetry itself is a problem caused by her poems."

      "extractable": true,
      "confidence": 0.5,

      "extractable": false,
      "confidence": 0.4,
      "reason": "While 'American poetry' is mentioned, the clothing connection is weak but exists; Dickinson's 'penchant for white clothing' is described, and she is a key figure in American poetry, creating a very indirect thematic link."

      "reason": "The paragraph states that a 'complete collection of her poetry first became available in 1955.' While this is about the completeness of Dickinson's poetry specifically, and not American poetry as a whole, there is a semantic connection between the completeness of a major American poet's work and the broader category of American poetry."
